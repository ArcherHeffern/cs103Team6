    <h3>Archer Heffern</h3>
    <p>I completed several key tasks in developing our project, including creating the necessary pages (index, form) and routes. I also took care of configuring the project structure and setup, including creating a virtual environment for development. In addition, I created custom styles to ensure a cohesive look and feel across the website. Finally, I documented my work by writing a comprehensive README.md file that provides clear instructions on how to use the project.</p>
